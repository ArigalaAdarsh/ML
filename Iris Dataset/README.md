# Iris Dataset Classification Project

## Overview

In this project, we use the **Iris dataset** to perform classification tasks using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**. Additionally, **Hyperparameter Tuning** is performed using **RandomizedSearchCV** and **GridSearchCV** to optimize the models' performance. The goal is to predict the species of the Iris flowers based on the measurements of the flowers' sepals and petals.

## Dataset

The **Iris dataset** contains 150 observations of iris flowers, each characterized by the following features:

- `sepal_length`: The length of the sepal in centimeters.
- `sepal_width`: The width of the sepal in centimeters.
- `petal_length`: The length of the petal in centimeters.
- `petal_width`: The width of the petal in centimeters.
- `species`: The species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) â€” This is the target variable.

The dataset is widely used for classification tasks in machine learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
