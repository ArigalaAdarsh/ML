# User Data Classification using Random Forest Algorithm

## Overview

In this project, we aim to predict whether a user is likely to purchase a product based on features such as **Age**, **EstimatedSalary**, and **Gender** using the **Random Forest** algorithm. The dataset contains information about users, including their **User ID**, **Gender**, **Age**, **EstimatedSalary**, and whether they **Purchased** the product (target variable).

We will perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train an Random Forest classifier to predict whether a user will purchase the product.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in `User_Data.csv`. The columns are as follows:

- **User ID**: Unique identifier for the user.
- **Gender**: Gender of the user (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Age of the user.
- **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated salary of the user.
- **Purchased**: Target variable indicating whether the user made a purchase (0: No, 1: Yes).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **Plotly Express**: For interactive data visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
