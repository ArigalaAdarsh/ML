Sales Analysis Project Overview
Problem Statement

The company is currently facing a financial crisis and requires a comprehensive sales analysis to understand optimal sales conditions and predict potential losses. This analysis involves:

    Identifying peak sales periods, such as holidays, and predicting potential losses.
    Analyzing the impact of climatic conditions, weekdays/weekends, and special offers/festivals on sales.
    Segmenting sales data based on specific conditions to understand consumer behavior variations.

Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

    Sales Pattern Analysis:
        Analyze sales data in correlation with temperature variations.
        Identify peak sales days around holidays and festivals.
        Differentiate sales data between weekdays and weekends to understand consumer behavior.

    Predictive Analytics:
        Develop predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data.
        Enhance sales predictions by considering economic indicators and market trends.

    Marketing and Resource Optimization:
        Plan targeted marketing and promotional strategies based on identified sales patterns.
        Optimize staffing, inventory management, and promotions to meet expected demand during peak periods.

Approach

To achieve the project objectives, we will undertake the following steps:

    Data Collection:
        Gather historical sales data including timestamps, product details, sales volumes, and external factors (temperature, holidays, etc.).

    Data Preprocessing:
        Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Perform EDA to understand trends, correlations, and patterns in the sales data based on specific conditions (temperature, holidays, weekdays/weekends).

    Feature Engineering:
        Create new features based on extracted insights from EDA (e.g., holiday indicators, temperature categories).

    Predictive Modeling:
        Build predictive models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict future sales based on historical data and external factors.

    Analysis and Insights:
        Analyze model results to understand the impact of different conditions (temperature, holidays, weekdays/weekends) on sales.
        Extract actionable insights for marketing strategies, inventory management, and resource allocation.
