# Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, we applied various statistical techniques and tests to analyze a dataset containing user information and product purchases. The analysis includes **Descriptive Statistics**, **Hypothesis Testing**, **ANOVA**, **Chi-square tests**, and other advanced statistical methods using libraries like **SciPy**, **StatsModels**, and **Seaborn** for visualization.

The primary objective of this project was to explore and apply statistical methods to understand the relationships between the features in the dataset and make inferences.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on user purchases along with demographic details. The columns in the dataset include:

- `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `Product_ID`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `Gender`: Gender of the user (Male/Female).
- `Age`: Age group of the user.
- `Occupation`: Occupation type of the user.
- `City_Category`: Category of the city (A/B/C).
- `Stay_In_Current_City_Years`: Number of years the user has stayed in the current city.
- `Marital_Status`: Marital status of the user (Married/Single).
- `Product_Category_1`, `Product_Category_2`, `Product_Category_3`: Product categories purchased by the user.
- `Purchase`: Total purchase amount made by the user.

This dataset is used for various statistical analyses and hypothesis testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and statistical tests.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **SciPy**: For statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square, etc.).
- **StatsModels**: For statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Warnings**: For handling warning messages in the analysis.
