# Bioinfokit.analys: Z-test and T-test Statistical Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I performed **statistical analysis** using **Z-test** and **T-test** for hypothesis testing. These statistical tests are used to determine if there is a significant difference between two datasets or groups. The goal was to explore and understand how to perform and interpret these tests using Python and the **Bioinfokit** library.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for the analysis
- **Bioinfokit**: Library for statistical analysis and visualization
- **SciPy**: Library used for the Z-test and T-test computations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **mtcars** dataset, which contains various attributes of different car models. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `mpg`: Miles per gallon
- `cyl`: Number of cylinders
- `disp`: Displacement (cu. in.)
- `hp`: Gross horsepower
- `drat`: Rear axle ratio
- `wt`: Weight (1000 lbs)
- `qsec`: 1/4 mile time
- `vs`: Engine (0 = V/S, 1 = straight)
- `am`: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- `gear`: Number of forward gears
- `carb`: Number of carburetors

The **mtcars** dataset is included in this repository as a `.csv` file and can be accessed for analysis.
