# Bioinfokit.analys: Z-test and T-test Statistical Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I performed **statistical analysis** using **Z-test** and **T-test** for hypothesis testing. These statistical tests are used to determine if there is a significant difference between two datasets or groups. The goal was to explore and understand how to perform and interpret these tests using Python and the **Bioinfokit** library.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for the analysis
- **Bioinfokit**: Library for statistical analysis and visualization
- **SciPy**: Library used for the Z-test and T-test computations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations
